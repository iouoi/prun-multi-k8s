#Access Modes : when the pod config is sent to k8s, k8s will have to find an instance of storage that supports this access mode
# ReadWriteOnce: can be used by a single node
# ReadOnlyMany: multiple nodes can read from this
# ReadWriteMany: can be read and written to by many nodes

# Statically provisioned persisten volume & Dynamically providioned

# 'storageClassName' - we're relying on default atm (on dev mode, a little slice on our local machine; on production / cloud provider, it has its own default storage option) (where k8s will create file system to allocate to your pod)

# PVC: essentially advertising an option that can be used for storage by all different pods in our app
